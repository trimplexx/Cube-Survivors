# Cube Survivors
- Cube Survivors is a RogueLike style game. In this title, the player’s task is to score points by eliminating enemies and developing their character by activating and upgrading special powers.

## Game Mechanics:
### Controls:
- The player controls the character using the WSAD keys. The “W” key allows you to move forward, “S” - backwards, “A” - left, “D” - right.

### Shooting:
- The player’s character shoots automatically in the direction it is facing. The player must focus on determining the direction of the shots, while the shooting itself is automatic.

### Special Powers:
- The player can activate special powers. Each of these powers offers unique abilities that help in combat or provide a tactical advantage.

### Scoring Points:
- The player scores points by eliminating enemy mobs. Each mob eliminated by the player brings him a certain amount of points.

### Upgrading Special Powers:
- Points earned from mob eliminations can be used to upgrade the character’s special powers. This allows the player to customize their character to their style of play.

## Mobs:
### Automatic Generation:
- Enemy mobs are automatically generated at specific time intervals, creating an endless stream of enemies who try to attack the player’s character.

### Mob Movement:
- Mobs move towards the player’s character, trying to attack him. Their movement is chaotic, and some may have different abilities, such as jumps or sprints.

### Projectile Range Limits:
- Each mob has a limited range of its attack. This means that players can avoid shots by maintaining a proper distance from enemies.

## Environment:
### Terrain and All Models:
- The game uses models and textures from Quaternius - Cube World Kit.
